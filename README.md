## Twilio Workaround

* In order to have a two way conversation in What's App on Twilio, you'll need to establish a Session. However, a Session must be initiated by the user only and the Session will only live for 24 hours.
* So in order to workaround this issue, everyday in the morning, it'll start off with a greeting from the chatbot in the hopes that the user replies back.
* Limitations: If users doesn't reply, then no Session is created.
